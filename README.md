# API Resource

A simple project powered by PHP Laravel framework as backend and React.Js and Bootstrap framework as frontend.

## When to use
API Resource is an online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data.
It can be on a host, as a WordPress plugin or to test things locally.


## Installation
Its a PHP Laravel project, so first you need to install Composer then run this command in CMD:
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel api_resource
```

The project uses React.JS as a frontend framework, so you need to install `NPM` first then run this command in CMD:
```bash
npm run watch
```


### PHP Configuration

- Server

To run on a server, move all folders and files except `public` to a new folder, named `frm` for example.
It should be one level upper than the `public` folder for security reasons.

Open `.env` file in `frm` folder, and set database name, username and password of your database connection:
```bash
DB_DATABASE=api_resource
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=123456
```

Move content of `public` folder to `public_html`.

- Server & localhost

Set `$localhost = 0;`  in `index.php`, in case you're running the project on a server:

```bash
  $localhost = 1; // set 1 if you're running the project on localhost, otherwise 0
  $framework = $localhost === 1 ? '//../' : '//../frm/';
```

### JS Configuration
If you're running the project on a server, open `resources/js/constants/apiUrls.js`,
modify `LOCALHOST` value to 0 and `https://hosseinimh.com` to your server URL:
```bash
const LOCALHOST = 1; // set 1 if you're running the project on localhost, otherwise 0

export const SERVER_URL =
    LOCALHOST === 1
        ? "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api"
        : "https://hosseinimh.com/api";
```

#### Initialization
If you're on a server, go to `/initialize`:
```bash
  GET /initialize
```
If you're on localhost, you have two options to initialize the project:

- Go to `/initialize`
```bash
  GET /initialize
```
 - Or simply run a custom console command:
  ```bash
  php artisan project:init
```
If everything goes well, the output will be like this:
```bash
Cache was cleared successfully.
Old uploaded files were deleted successfully.
Symbolic links were created successfully.
Database tables were created successfully.
1 user was created successfully.
5 categories were created successfully.
15 books were created successfully.

****
Username: admin
Password: 1234
****

READY TO GO!
```

If you don't want to reset your database data and initialize the project anymore, just remove this line in `routes/web.php`:
```bash
  Route::get('initialize', [Controller::class, 'initialize']);
```

## Documentation
#### Architecture
The project is based on MVC architecture, which Laravel recommends.
It uses Models, Controllers, and js files as Views.

The coding schema of the project is shown in the picture below:

The project uses `API Resources` as `Repositories` to standardize responses.
It also utilizes Laravel ORM Laravel, Eloquents, for readability and integration.

#### Database
The project uses `MySQL` which is an open-source relational database management system.

#### JWT Tokens
As API calls are stateless, sessions can't be used to identify users.
I use `JWT tokens` to authenticate and authorize users.
On the backend, I use `middlewares` to handle users accessing endpoint routes.

#### UI
The project utilizes [coreui](https://coreui.io/) which is a free Bootstrap Admin Dashboard Template, and I made some changes to it.
