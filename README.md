# API Resource

A simple project powered by PHP Laravel framework as backend and React.Js and Bootstrap framework as frontend.

## When to use
API Resource is an online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data. It can be on a host, as a Wordpress plugin or to test things locally.


## Installation
- Server

To run on server, move all folders and files except `public` to a new folder, named `frm` for example.
It should be one level upper than `public` folder for security reasons.

Open `.env` file in `frm` folder, and set database name, username and password of your database connection:
```bash
DB_DATABASE=api_resource
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=123456
```

Move content of `public` folder to `public_html`.

- Server & localhost

Set `$localhost = 0;`  in `index.php`, if you're running project on server:

```bash
  $localhost = 1; // set 1 if you're running project on localhost, otherwise 0
  $framework = $localhost === 1 ? '//../' : '//../frm/';
```

#### Initialization
If you're on server, go to `/initialize`:
```bash
  GET /initialize
```
If you're on localhost, you have two options to initialize project:

Go to `/initialize`
```bash
  GET /initialize
```
 Or simply run custom console command:
  ```bash
  php artisan project:init
```
If everything goes well, the output will be like this:
```bash
Cache cleared successfully.
Old uploaded files deleted successfully.
Symbolic links created successfully.
Database tables created successfully.
1 user created successfully.
5 categories created successfully.
15 books created successfully.

****
Username: admin
Password: 1234

****
READY TO GO!
```

If you want not to reset your database data and project initialization anymore, just remove this line in `routes/web.php`:
```bash
  Route::get('initialize', [Controller::class, 'initialize']);
```
